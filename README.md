# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Group our transactions

> This a project from the Microverse course built for mobile screens. The objective is to keep track of the hours you spend on a specific task when working on a project.

## Features
- User can Log in with proper authentication(email and password), and have a default user profile image that can be updated in the account settings.
- User can create a task where you enter the hours spent and can be assigned to a Project.
- When you click on 'My Hours' you can see a list of your tasks assigned to an specific project and the total hours you registered. This list shows only the tasks created by you.
- When you click on 'Non Categorised hours' you can see a list of tasks not assigned to an specific project when created, and the total hours of those tasks.
- Inside My Hours and Projects you are able to create a new task or Project with the 'Add new' button
- Also you are able to edit and delete all the taks and projects created by you. If you delete a Project all the tasks assigned to that project will be deleted as well.
